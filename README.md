## Introduction

Fish Folk: Jumpy is a tactical 2D shooter, played by up to 4 players online or on a shared screen. Aim either left or right; the rest is up to clever movement and positioning in this fish-on-fish brawler! For more information about our origin story (Duck Game et.al.) and big-picture plans, see our [design document](https://www.notion.so/erlendsh/Fish-Fight-1647ed74217e4e38a59bd28f4f5bc81a).

## Web Demo

Jumpy runs in the browser! You can play [web demo][web_demo] to try out the game, without needing to install anything on your computer.

We recommend using the Chrome browser or other derivatives for best performance, or if you have issues with other browsers.

### Key Features (WIP)

- 2 to 4 players in either Local Multiplayer or Online Play
- Easy to pick up, emphasizing strategy over twitch reaction
- Customize characters with hats, saved to your cross-platform profile
- Create & explore user-made weapons, levels, audio and other scripted extensions
- Smart level creation tools
- Tournaments & matchmaking built in

### Status

The game is currently under re-construction as it is being rewritten to use the [Bevy] game engine. There are now 4 stable maps and 4 items in the new version, and the game is nearly ready for another release.

### Development Build Profiles

By default, Jumpy will build without optimizations for the `jumpy_core` and `jumpy` crates. This helps reduce re-compile times at the expense of some runtime performance. If you need increased runtime performance during development, you can build with the `--profile dev-optimized` option, to optimize all of the crates:

```bash
cargo r --profile dev-optimized
```
